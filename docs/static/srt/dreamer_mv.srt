1
00:00:04,338 --> 00:00:07,549
Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah

2
00:00:08,717 --> 00:00:10,594
Oh no no no no

3
00:00:10,928 --> 00:00:14,389
Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah

4
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:22,856
I remember it like it was yesterday

5
00:00:23,315 --> 00:00:29,071
I was just running single-mindedly

6
00:00:29,238 --> 00:00:35,327
And before I realized, I was standing still,

7
00:00:35,494 --> 00:00:40,916
Unable to move forward

8
00:00:41,124 --> 00:00:44,711
But there's a place that I want to reach,

9
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:47,965
So I'll continue walking

10
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:51,301
And I’ll be holding on to the light

11
00:00:51,468 --> 00:00:54,554
That I received from you

12
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:58,100
Towards the other side

13
00:00:58,267 --> 00:01:01,520
of the dream I envisioned

14
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:07,067
I’m sure I can walk together with you

15
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:10,779
We are still dreamers, dreamers

16
00:01:10,946 --> 00:01:14,074
Go closer and closer, without hesitation

17
00:01:14,241 --> 00:01:18,370
This feeling is getting closer (Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah)

18
00:01:18,537 --> 00:01:21,248
It’ll always be in my heart (Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah)

19
00:01:21,415 --> 00:01:23,875
Don't ever let go of this hand

20
00:01:24,293 --> 00:01:27,879
We'll walk together

21
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:33,135
towards tomorrow

22
00:01:33,302 --> 00:01:37,431
One step at a time

23
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:45,147
Sometimes I make mistakes

24
00:01:45,314 --> 00:01:48,609
ut because you're here, today, I'll only look forward

25
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:51,737
The promise we decided on

26
00:01:51,903 --> 00:01:54,364
It's a secret nobody else knows

27
00:01:54,531 --> 00:02:00,912
Before I realized it

28
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:06,168
you were always by my side

29
00:02:06,418 --> 00:02:10,213
As I hugged my knees and looked down

30
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:13,175
You reached out towards me

31
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:16,720
Even up till now

32
00:02:16,887 --> 00:02:20,015
I can't forget the warmth of that smile

33
00:02:20,182 --> 00:02:23,477
If something

34
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:27,022
Had been just a little different

35
00:02:27,189 --> 00:02:32,986
Maybe we would have never met

36
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:36,239
We are still dreamers, dreamers

37
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:39,576
Little by little, together with you

38
00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:43,914
The memories of the two of us that we carved (Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah)

39
00:02:44,081 --> 00:02:46,792
It's a miracle that will never happen again (Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah)

40
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:49,628
Even if it wasn't fate

41
00:02:49,795 --> 00:02:53,340
But just a coincidence

42
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:58,637
This special feeling

43
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:01,598
Will never change

44
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:04,851
Even if we get battered by the wind and rain

45
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:08,146
Even if we get tossed around by the rough waves

46
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:12,401
Even if we can't see where we're headed yet

47
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:16,363
We don't need to hide

48
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:19,825
Our weak hearts

49
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:25,622
It's alright, believe in yourself

50
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:28,792
We are still dreamers, dreamers

51
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:32,379
Go closer and closer, without hesitation

52
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:36,383
This feeling is getting closer (Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah)

53
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:39,469
It'll always be in my heart (Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah)

54
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:42,222
Don’t ever let go of this hand

55
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:45,976
We'll walk together

56
00:03:46,143 --> 00:03:51,148
Towards tomorrow

57
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:56,278
One step at a time
